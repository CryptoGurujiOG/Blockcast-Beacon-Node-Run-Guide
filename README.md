# Blockcast-Beacon-Node-Run-Guide

Blockcast is a decentralized content delivery network (CDN) that lets anyone contribute bandwidth and storage to speed up internet content delivery. Instead of relying on a few big CDN companies, Blockcast uses community-run nodes to deliver content locally, faster, and more efficientlyâ€”powered by DePIN, with economic incentives, privacy protections, and verifiable uptime.

---

## Rewards:

- By running a Blockcast beacon node, you earn points that will later convert into tokens.
- Blockcast has launched a 6-month campaign â€” top-performing nodes will receive a special NFT.

---

## Requirements:

- Minimum (2 vCPU, 2 GB RAM, 20 GB SSD, Stable Internet, Ubuntu 22.04)
- Recommended (4+ vCPU, 4+ GB RAM, 50+ GB SSD, Stable Internet, Ubuntu 22.04)
- More CPU, RAM, and Storage will improve performance and stability.

---

## Suggestion:

- You can run this node on your Windows PC, but I recommend using a VPS for better performance and uptime, especially if you're targeting the NFT reward.
- If you are only aiming to earn points, running it on your Windows device is fine.
